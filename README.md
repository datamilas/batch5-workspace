## Workspace for Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy


A course providing an introduction to Data Science through the combination of Bootcamp, Hackathons, and a Capstone project 
Bootcamp: Data Visualisation, Statistics, Data Diagnostics, Data cleaning, Regression, Classification, Model Validation, Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning
Hackathons: Binary Classification, Data Wrangling, Time Series, Text Classification, Recommender Systems, Data Science in the real world

Capstone Project: analysis and prediction of wrongful hospital discharges using real-world data
- Analyzed data of around 80 000 hospital discharges to identify potential discrimination based on age, gender, race, and insurance status of the patients
- Tested several classification algorithms to build a model to predict the wrongful discharges
- Deployed a Random Forest Classification model in the form of API using Heroku
- Wrote two reports aimed at both technical and business audiences (these are [here](https://github.com/datamilas/batch5-workspace/tree/main/Capstone/Reports))
